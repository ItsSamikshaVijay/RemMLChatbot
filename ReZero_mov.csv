Puck , Die.
Conti , My brain trembles...
Subaru Natsuki , Puck!
Puck ," Be quiet, Subaru."
Puck , I don't care what you—
Conti , Complacency! Negligence! That is sloth!
Conti , You should have killed me right away!
Conti ," Even with the power you have,"
Conti , you failed to do what you needed to do!
Puck , Foolishness.
Puck , If you truly want to kill me...
Puck ," Then grow a thousand shadows, half of what Satella could..."
Subaru Natsuki , Are you... Puck?
Puck , Can't you tell?
Puck , Maybe it's cruel of me to ask that.
Conti , Unbelievable...
Conti , This is unbelievable!
Conti , It cannot be!
Conti , A mere spirit...
Conti , My faith...
Conti , Everything I've devoted my love to...
Conti , At the hands of a mere spirit—
Puck , A human who's only lived a few decades shouldn't talk to a spirit about time.
Conti , Time has nothing to do with the depth of one's faith!
Conti ," I wish you wouldn't liken me to a fool like you, a being that lives for eternity, but wastes most of it in idleness!"
Conti ," Ah, my brain is tremblinglinglingling..."
Puck , Death isn't even a punishment.
Puck , This is why I hate all of you.
Conti , The Ordeal has been completed.
Conti ," Even if my body dies, my wishes will be called to the exalted witch's side."
Conti , And I'll receive her love.
Conti , I look forward to our reunion!
Puck , He quit while he was ahead.
Puck ," Now, shall we have a little talk?"
Puck ," Subaru, you have committed three sins."
Puck ," First, you broke your promise to Lia."
Puck , You don't seem to understand how important a promise is to a spirit-arts user.
Puck ," Second, you ignored Lia's wishes and returned here."
Puck , And third...
Puck , You let Lia die!
Puck ," In accordance with my contract, I will now destroy the world."
Subaru Natsuki , Why?
Puck , Lia is...
Puck , Emilia is my entire reason for existing.
Puck , There is no reason for me to exist in a world without her.
Puck , The fog is coming closer.
Puck , It looks like a troublesome one has been drawn here.
Puck , Gluttony...
Puck ," Oh, I suppose they call it the White Whale now."
Puck ," You called it here, let Lia die, and now, you die yourself."
Puck , You really are useless.
Subaru Natsuki , I've heard this laugh before.
Subaru Natsuki , The voice of a man I hated to death.
Subaru Natsuki , No... It's me.
Subaru Natsuki , I'm laughing at myself.
Subaru Natsuki ," I let Rem die, killed Emilia, and now, I'm going to die in vain."
Subaru Natsuki , I really am so...
Puck ," You truly are slothful, Subaru."
Rem , Subaru-kun?
Rem , What's the matter?
Subaru Natsuki , Rem...
Rem ," Yes, I'm your Rem."
Rem , I'm sorry I didn't notice...
Rem ," This crowd is tiring you, isn't it?"
Subaru Natsuki , Tired.
Subaru Natsuki ," Yeah, that's right..."
Subaru Natsuki ," I'm out of energy, worn down..."
Subaru Natsuki , I'm tired.
Rem , Subaru-kun!
Subaru Natsuki , Sorry about that...
Subaru Natsuki ," I was feeling kind of stressed,so I skipped out on explaining."
Subaru Natsuki , Sorry.
Rem ," Really, you mustn't do that..."
Rem , I realize that you are giving a great deal of thought to our situation.
Rem , But I don't dislike it when you are so forceful.
Subaru Natsuki , Sorry that I worried you.
Subaru Natsuki , I'm fine now.
Subaru Natsuki ," I guess you've seen me just being pathetic, depressed all the time..."
Subaru Natsuki , But I get it now.
Rem , You get it now?
Subaru Natsuki ," I've bothered a lot of people with all my contemplating and agonizing,but I finally figured out how to take care of everything."
Subaru Natsuki ," Or, when I really think about it, I was told what to do from the very start."
Subaru Natsuki , But I don't know when to give up...
Rem , But I think that is what's so wonderful about you.
Subaru Natsuki , Things I've realized
Subaru Natsuki ," All kinds of experiences have brought me here,but I've actually had the answer for a long time..."
Subaru Natsuki ," I've decided, Rem."
Rem , Yes?
Subaru Natsuki , Run away with me.
Subaru Natsuki , As far as we can go.
Rem , Huh?
Subaru Natsuki ," I'm going to leave the capital, to head far west."
Subaru Natsuki , Or maybe north.
Rem , Um...
Subaru Natsuki ," I heard no one can enter the southern kingdom, so one of those two."
Subaru Natsuki ," I don't like cold weather, so I'd personally recommend west."
Rem ," Ah, um..."
Subaru Natsuki ," Honestly, it could be a long journey, and I know this is a snap decision, so it won't be easy—"
Rem , P-Please wait!
Rem , The way you said that makes it sound as if you plan to go to some other country that isn't Lugunica...
Rem , Oh!
Rem ," Knowing you, it must be because you've had another great idea!"
Rem , Something that will help Emilia-sama and Roswaal-sama!
Subaru Natsuki ," That's not what this is, Rem."
Subaru Natsuki , There's nothing I can do in the capital.
Subaru Natsuki , But I'd be just as powerless if I went back to the mansion.
Subaru Natsuki , That's what I figured out.
Subaru Natsuki ," So run away with me, Rem."
Subaru Natsuki , We can't stay here.
Subaru Natsuki , That's what everyone has been telling me.
Subaru Natsuki ," I didn't want to believe it, so I've denied it with all my might, but..."
Subaru Natsuki ," Yeah, they're right."
Subaru Natsuki , No one ever needed me.
Rem , That's not—
Subaru Natsuki , It is true!
Subaru Natsuki ," It's been spelled out for me, over and over..."
Subaru Natsuki , That's why I've decided to just disappear.
Subaru Natsuki , It's for the best.
Subaru Natsuki , Anything I do will just lead to a dead body...
Subaru Natsuki ," Or maybe more, depending on what happens."
Subaru Natsuki , I've had enough.
Subaru Natsuki ," Let's run, Rem."
Subaru Natsuki , You and I can't stay here.
Subaru Natsuki , We shouldn't be in this country!
Rem , But this is so sudden...
Subaru Natsuki , We don't have time!
Subaru Natsuki ," I'm sorry it's sudden, I really am."
Subaru Natsuki ," I really, really am."
Subaru Natsuki , But you have to choose.
Rem , Choose?
Subaru Natsuki , Me? Or someone else?
Subaru Natsuki , Choose.
Subaru Natsuki , Let's get a dragon-drawn carriage and head west.
Subaru Natsuki ," We'll leave Lugunica and go far west... To Kararagi, was it?"
Subaru Natsuki , We'll buy a little house and live there together.
Subaru Natsuki ," Even if bad things happen,I can keep going if you're there."
Subaru Natsuki , Just having someone waiting at home for me with a smile...
Subaru Natsuki ," No matter how tired I am,"
Subaru Natsuki ," if I know you're waiting for me, I know..."
Subaru Natsuki , Please choose me!
Subaru Natsuki ," If you choose me, I'll give you all that I have!"
Subaru Natsuki , So please...
Subaru Natsuki , Run away with me.
Subaru Natsuki , Live with me!
Rem , Subaru-kun...
Rem , I cannot run away with you.
Rem ," We're supposed to laugh together,"
Rem ," as we talk about the future, remember?"
Subaru Natsuki ," Maybe we can't laugh now, but...	"
Subaru Natsuki ," You know, once we actually get moving,	"
Subaru Natsuki , I bet we can—	
Rem ," I have thought about it, too."
Rem ," We would arrive in Kararagi,	"
Rem , and rent a place to stay.	
Rem ," As long as we had a home and work,"
Rem , we would get by somehow.
Rem ," Fortunately, thanks to Roswaal-sama, I have received an education,	"
Rem ," so I think I could easily find work, even in Kararagi."
Rem , You might have to either look for manual labor
Rem , or take care of things around me.	
Rem ," Once we had a stable income,"
Rem , we could look for a better place to live.
Rem ," In the meantime, you could study"
Rem ," for perhaps a year, so that you can find"
Rem ," a decent job, until you can actually work."
Rem , We would work together.
Rem ," And once we had enough money,perhaps we could buy a house.	"
Rem , Maybe we could even open a shop.
Rem ," After all, Kararagi is a thriving commercial area."
Rem , I'm sure we could earn a living on one of your fanciful ideas.
Rem , And once our jobs were on track...
Rem ," Um, it's embarrassing to say,"
Rem , but we could have a child.
Rem ," It would be half-demon and half-human,"
Rem , so I'm certain it would be feisty.
Rem ," Whether we have a boy or a girl,"
Rem ," twins or even triplets,"
Rem , I know they would be adorable.
Rem , I'm sure it wouldn't be all fun times.
Rem , And not everything would work out as I imagined it.
Rem ," We might have only daughters and no sons,"
Rem , so you might not feel very proud of your family.
Subaru Natsuki , Rem...
Rem , But... But... Even when the children grow
Rem ," and reach the age where they start to treat you coldly,"
Rem , I shall still be on your side!
Rem ," We will be famous in the neighborhood as a couple of old lovebirds,"
Rem , as we take our time spending life together and growing old...
Subaru Natsuki , Rem...
Rem ," I would feel bad for doing it to you,"
Rem ," but I would prefer to die before you, if possible."
Rem ," I want to die quietly,"
Rem ," lying on our bed, with your hand in mine,	"
Rem , surrounded by our children and their children.	
Rem ," To say, ""I was so happy,""	"
Rem , as you all look on...	
Rem ," I could end my life happily, so happily.	"
Subaru Natsuki , If you...
Subaru Natsuki ," If you want it that badly, then..."
Rem ," If you could wish for that future with a smile,"
Rem , I would be truly happy to die that way...	
Rem , As long as I could live with you.	
Rem , Just knowing that you want me with you when you run away
Rem ," makes me happy, from the bottom of my heart.	"
Rem , But I cannot.
Rem , Because I know	
Rem ," that if we run away together now,"
Rem , I would be leaving behind the Subaru-kun that I love most.	
Rem ," Subaru-kun,"
Rem , please tell me what happened.
Rem ," If you cannot, please trust me.	"
Rem , I swear I shall do something to make it right.
Rem ," But for now, at least, we should go back."
Rem ," If we take our time,and consider things calmly,"
Rem , maybe we will find a different answer.
Subaru Natsuki , I've already agonized over this.
Subaru Natsuki , I've thought about it.
Subaru Natsuki , I've suffered.
Subaru Natsuki , That's why I gave up.
Rem ," It's easy to give up, but..."
Subaru Natsuki , It's easy to give up?
Rem , Subaru-kun?
Subaru Natsuki , Don't give me that!
Subaru Natsuki , There's nothing easy about giving up!
Subaru Natsuki ," You think I'm just doing nothing,"
Subaru Natsuki ," thinking about nothing,"
Subaru Natsuki ," cutting myself off from everything,"
Subaru Natsuki , and throwing everything away!
Subaru Natsuki , And that's all it took to give up?!
Subaru Natsuki , It was not easy to give up!
Subaru Natsuki , It was so much easier for me to think	
Subaru Natsuki , there was something I could do!	
Subaru Natsuki , But there's nothing I can do...	
Subaru Natsuki , There's no way out!	
Subaru Natsuki , The only path everything leads to is giving up!	
Subaru Natsuki ," If I could do something,	"
Subaru Natsuki , I would... I would...	
Rem , Subaru-kun...	
Rem , It is easy to give up.	
Rem , But it doesn't suit you.	
Rem ," I do not know what painful things you've been through,	"
Rem , or what you have done to make you suffer so.	
Rem , And I know it would be wrong of me
Rem , to thoughtlessly say I understand.
Rem , But... But even so...	
Rem , There is something that I do know.	
Rem , I know that you're someone who cannot give up on something halfway through.
Rem , I know that you are someone who can smile
Rem , when you talk about your wishes for the future.	
Rem , I know...	
Rem , I know that you are someone who cannot give up on the future.	
Subaru Natsuki , You're wrong.	
Subaru Natsuki , I'm not that kind of—	
Rem , I am not wrong.	
Rem , You haven't given up on anyone.	
Rem , Not Emilia-sama or Sister.	
Rem ," Or Roswaal-sama, or Beatrice-sama, or anyone else.	"
Subaru Natsuki , I have... I have given up!
Subaru Natsuki , Carrying it all was impossible from the start!	(0:14:19.90)
Subaru Natsuki ," My hands are so small,"
Subaru Natsuki ," that it all slipped through my fingers, leaving nothing."
Rem ," No, that isn't true. You have—"
Subaru Natsuki , What do you know?!
Subaru Natsuki , What do you know about me?!	
Subaru Natsuki , This is the kind of man I am!	
Subaru Natsuki ," I have no strength, but I want it all.	"
Subaru Natsuki ," I have no knowledge, but all I do is dream."
Subaru Natsuki ," There's nothing I can do, but I struggle in vain!	"
Subaru Natsuki , I... I...	
Subaru Natsuki , I hate myself!	
Subaru Natsuki ," All I do is talk a big game,	"
Subaru Natsuki ," and make myself sound like a big shot, when I can't do anything!	"
Subaru Natsuki ," I never do anything,	"
Subaru Natsuki , yet I can complain like a pro.	
Subaru Natsuki , Who do I think I am?!	
Subaru Natsuki , It's amazing that I can live like this and not feel ashamed!	
Subaru Natsuki , Right?!	
Subaru Natsuki , I'm empty...	
Subaru Natsuki , There's nothing in me at all!
Subaru Natsuki , I know that...	
Subaru Natsuki ," Yeah, that's obvious...	"
Subaru Natsuki , I know it's obvious.
Subaru Natsuki , Before I came here...	
Subaru Natsuki ," Before I got into the situation that led me to all of you,	"
Subaru Natsuki , do you have any idea what I did?	
Subaru Natsuki , I did nothing...	
Subaru Natsuki , I've never done a single thing.	
Subaru Natsuki ," I had all that time, all that freedom..."
Subaru Natsuki ," I could have done anything,"
Subaru Natsuki , but I never did a thing.	
Subaru Natsuki , And this is the result! What I am now is the result!	
Subaru Natsuki ," All of my powerlessness, all of my incompetence,	"
Subaru Natsuki , is the product of my rotten character.	
Subaru Natsuki ," Wanting to accomplish something, when I've never done anything,	"
Subaru Natsuki , goes beyond the limits of arrogance!	
Subaru Natsuki , The cost of my laziness and all the wasteful habits in my life	
Subaru Natsuki , just ends up killing both you and me.	
Subaru Natsuki , That's right.	
Subaru Natsuki , I have no character.
Subaru Natsuki ," Even when I thought I could go on living here, nothing changed...	"
Subaru Natsuki , That old man saw that part of me perfectly.
Subaru Natsuki , Right?
Subaru Natsuki ," I wasn't trying to get stronger,"
Subaru Natsuki , or trying to make things better.	
Subaru Natsuki ," I was just striking an obvious pose, to justify myself,	"
Subaru Natsuki ," to say that I was trying, that it wasn't like I wasn't doing anything.	"
Subaru Natsuki , I wanted to say I couldn't help it.
Subaru Natsuki , I wanted to be told that it couldn't be helped!
Subaru Natsuki ," I only pretended to push my body to the limit, so that would be possible!"
Subaru Natsuki ," Even when I had you help me study,	"
Subaru Natsuki , I was just posing to cover up how embarrassed I felt!	
Subaru Natsuki ," At heart,	"
Subaru Natsuki ," I'm just a small, cowardly, filthy piece of trash,	"
Subaru Natsuki , who's always worried about how others see me. And nothing...	
Subaru Natsuki , Nothing about me has changed!	
Subaru Natsuki , I knew it all along.	
Subaru Natsuki , That all of it was my fault...
Subaru Natsuki , I'm the lowest of the low.	
Subaru Natsuki , I absolutely hate myself...	
Rem , I know...	
Rem ," That no matter how deeply you have fallen into darkness,"
Rem , you still have the courage to reach out your hand.	
Rem , I love it when you stroke my hair.	
Rem , I feel as if we can understand each other	
Rem , through the contact between your hand and my hair.	
Rem , I love your voice.	
Rem , Just hearing you say one word	
Rem , makes my heart feel warmer.	
Rem , I love your eyes.	
Rem ," Normally, they look stern,	"
Rem ," but when you're being kind to someone,	"
Rem , I love the way they soften.	
Rem , I love your fingers.	
Rem ," For a boy, you have such lovely fingers.	"
Rem ," But when they clutch mine, I know they are the strong,"
Rem , slender fingers of a man.
Rem , I love the way you walk.
Rem ," When we walk together,"
Rem ," I love the way you occasionally turn,to make sure I keep up."
Subaru Natsuki , Stop...
Rem , I love the way you look when you sleep.
Rem ," You look unguarded, like an infant,	"
Rem , and your eyelashes are on the long side.	
Rem ," When I touch your cheek, you calm down..."
Rem ," And when I playfully touch your lips, you don't even notice..."
Rem , And it makes my heart ache terribly.
Rem , I love you.
Subaru Natsuki , Why?
Rem ," When you said that you hate yourself,	"
Rem , it made me want to tell you	
Rem , all the wonderful things I know about you.	
Subaru Natsuki , That was all phony.	
Subaru Natsuki , You just don't know me!	
Subaru Natsuki , I know myself better than anyone!	
Rem , All you know is yourself!	
Rem , How much do you know about the Subaru-kun that I see?!	
Subaru Natsuki , Why... do you like me so much?	
Subaru Natsuki , I'm...	
Subaru Natsuki , I'm weak and small.	
Subaru Natsuki , I'm running away.	
Subaru Natsuki , Just like I ran away last time!	
Subaru Natsuki , So why?	
Rem ," Because you are my hero, Subaru-kun!	"
Rem ," In that dark forest,	"
Rem , when I didn't even know who I was anymore	
Rem ," and couldn't think of anything but violently lashing out,"
Rem , you saved me.
Rem ," When I woke up unable to move,"
Rem ," and Sister was exhausted after using too much magic,"
Rem ," you faced the mabeasts as a diversion, so we could escape."
Rem ," There was no way you could win,"
Rem , and your life was in real danger.
Rem ," But you still stayed,"
Rem ," and came back to my arms, still warm."
Rem ," When you woke up, you smiled,"
Rem ," and said the words I wanted to hear most,"
Rem ," when I wanted to hear them most,"
Rem , from the one I wanted most to hear them from.
Rem , My time has been stopped for so long.
Rem ," Ever since that fiery night,"
Rem ," the night I lost everything except my sister,"
Rem , my time has been stopped...
Rem ," It was you who melted my frozen heart,"
Rem , and kindly made my stopped time begin to move forward again!
Rem ," I'm sure you have no idea how you saved me,"
Rem ," or how happy I was at that moment, on that morning."
Rem , That's why I believe.
Rem ," No matter what painful things happen,"
Rem , even when it looks like you'll lose...
Rem ," When no one else in the world believes in you,"
Rem , when you don't even believe in yourself...
Rem , I will believe!
Rem , That the Subaru-kun who saved me
Rem , is a true hero.
Subaru Natsuki ," No matter how hard I tried,"
Subaru Natsuki , I couldn't save anyone...
Rem , I am here.
Rem , The Rem you saved is right here.
Subaru Natsuki , I've never done anything. I'm empty.
Subaru Natsuki , No one will even listen to me.
Rem , I am here.
Rem , I will listen to anything you have to say.
Rem , I want to.	
Subaru Natsuki , No one expects anything of me.
Subaru Natsuki , No one believes in me.
Subaru Natsuki , I hate myself.	
Rem ," Well, I love you, Subaru-kun!"
Subaru Natsuki , You really don't mind that it's me?	
Rem , I want it to be you.	
Rem , I would not want for it to be anyone else.	
Rem , If you cannot forgive yourself	
Rem ," for being empty and having nothing,	"
Rem ," then let us start from here, right now.	"
Subaru Natsuki , Start what?	
Rem , Just like you started my time for me
Rem , we will make the time that you feel is stopped for you	
Rem , begin to move again.	
Rem , Let us start here.	
Rem , From square one.	
Rem ," No,	"
Rem , from zero!	
Rem ," If it is too hard for you to walk alone,	"
Rem , I will hold you up.	
Rem ," As we walk, we will share the burden and support each other.	"
Rem , Wasn't this what you said to me that morning?	
Rem ," Show me how awesome you can be, Subaru-kun.	"
Subaru Natsuki , Rem...	
Rem , Yes?	
Subaru Natsuki , I love Emilia.	
Rem , Yes.	
Subaru Natsuki , I want to see Emilia smile.
Subaru Natsuki , I want to be of help to Emilia's future.	
Subaru Natsuki ," Even if she says I'm in the way,	"
Subaru Natsuki , even if she tells me to stay away...
Subaru Natsuki , I want to be next to her.	
Subaru Natsuki ," Using my feelings for her as an excuse,	"
Subaru Natsuki , to get her to understand everything	
Subaru Natsuki ," was arrogant of me, huh?	"
Subaru Natsuki , It's okay if she doesn't understand.	
Subaru Natsuki ," If there's a bleak, painful future waiting for her,	"
Subaru Natsuki , I want to take her away to a future where we can all laugh together!	
Subaru Natsuki , Will you help me?	
Subaru Natsuki , I can't do anything alone.	
Subaru Natsuki , I lack in everything.	
Subaru Natsuki , I'm not confident that I can even keep walking straight.	
Subaru Natsuki ," I'm weak, fragile, and small.	"
Subaru Natsuki ," So, to make sure I keep walking straight,	"
Subaru Natsuki ," to help me realize when I'm wrong,	"
Subaru Natsuki , will you help me?	
Rem ," You are a cruel man, Subaru-kun.	"
Rem , You ask all this of someone you just rejected?	
Subaru Natsuki ," Hey, it's also hard for me to ask this of the one who rejected	"
Subaru Natsuki , my once-in-a-lifetime proposal.	
Rem , I humbly accept.	
Rem ," If it will help you,	"
Rem ," my hero,	"
Rem ," greet the future with a smile, then yes.	"
Subaru Natsuki ," Yeah, just watch.	"
Subaru Natsuki , You get a front row seat...	
Subaru Natsuki , To see the man you fell for
Subaru Natsuki , become the most awesome hero ever!	
Subaru Natsuki , I'm watching you.	
Subaru Natsuki , You're watching me.	
Subaru Natsuki , So I won't look downward.	
Subaru Natsuki ," Natsuki Subaru's story will begin right here, from zero.	"
Subaru Natsuki ," My life in another world starts here, from zero!"
Puck, Die.
Conti, My brain trembles...
Subaru Natsuki, Puck!
Puck," Be quiet, Subaru."
Puck, I don't care what you—
Conti, Complacency! Negligence! That is sloth!
Conti, You should have killed me right away!
Conti," Even with the power you have,"
Conti, you failed to do what you needed to do!
Puck, Foolishness.
Puck, If you truly want to kill me...
Puck," Then grow a thousand shadows, half of what Satella could..."
Subaru Natsuki, Are you... Puck?
Puck, Can't you tell?
Puck, Maybe it's cruel of me to ask that.
Conti, Unbelievable...
Conti, This is unbelievable!
Conti, It cannot be!
Conti, A mere spirit...
Conti, My faith...
Conti, Everything I've devoted my love to...
Conti, At the hands of a mere spirit—
Puck, A human who's only lived a few decades shouldn't talk to a spirit about time.
Conti, Time has nothing to do with the depth of one's faith!

Puck," In accordance with my contract, I will now destroy the world."
Subaru Natsuki, Why?
Puck, Lia is...
Puck, Emilia is my entire reason for existing.
Puck, There is no reason for me to exist in a world without her.
Puck, The fog is coming closer.
Puck, It looks like a troublesome one has been drawn here.
Puck, Gluttony...
Puck," Oh, I suppose they call it the White Whale now."
Puck," You called it here, let Lia die, and now, you die yourself."
Puck, You really are useless.
Subaru Natsuki, I've heard this laugh before.
Subaru Natsuki, The voice of a man I hated to death.
Subaru Natsuki, No... It's me.
Subaru Natsuki, I'm laughing at myself.
Subaru Natsuki," I let Rem die, killed Emilia, and now, I'm going to die in vain."
Subaru Natsuki, I really am so...
Puck," You truly are slothful, Subaru."
Rem, Subaru-kun?
Rem, What's the matter?
Subaru Natsuki, Rem...
Rem," Yes, I'm your Rem."
Rem, I'm sorry I didn't notice...
Rem," This crowd is tiring you, isn't it?"
Subaru Natsuki, Tired.
Subaru Natsuki," Yeah, that's right..."
Subaru Natsuki," I'm out of energy, worn down..."
Subaru Natsuki, I'm tired.
Rem, Subaru-kun!
Subaru Natsuki, Sorry about that...
Subaru Natsuki," I was feeling kind of stressed,so I skipped out on explaining."
Subaru Natsuki, Sorry.
Rem," Really, you mustn't do that..."
Rem, I realize that you are giving a great deal of thought to our situation.
Rem, But I don't dislike it when you are so forceful.
Subaru Natsuki, Sorry that I worried you.
Subaru Natsuki, I'm fine now.
Subaru Natsuki," I guess you've seen me just being pathetic, depressed all the time..."
Subaru Natsuki, But I get it now.
Rem, You get it now?
Subaru Natsuki," I've bothered a lot of people with all my contemplating and agonizing,but I finally figured out how to take care of everything."
Subaru Natsuki," Or, when I really think about it, I was told what to do from the very start."
Subaru Natsuki, But I don't know when to give up...
Rem, But I think that is what's so wonderful about you.
Subaru Natsuki, Things I've realized
Subaru Natsuki," All kinds of experiences have brought me here,but I've actually had the answer for a long time..."
Subaru Natsuki," I've decided, Rem."
Rem, Yes?
Subaru Natsuki, Run away with me.
Subaru Natsuki, As far as we can go.
Rem, Huh?
Subaru Natsuki," I'm going to leave the capital, to head far west."

Subaru Natsuki," It's been spelled out for me, over and over..."
Subaru Natsuki, That's why I've decided to just disappear.
Subaru Natsuki, It's for the best.
Subaru Natsuki, Anything I do will just lead to a dead body...
Subaru Natsuki," Or maybe more, depending on what happens."
Subaru Natsuki, I've had enough.
Subaru Natsuki," Let's run, Rem."
Subaru Natsuki, You and I can't stay here.
Subaru Natsuki, We shouldn't be in this country!
Rem, But this is so sudden...
Subaru Natsuki, We don't have time!
Subaru Natsuki," I'm sorry it's sudden, I really am."
Subaru Natsuki," I really, really am."
Subaru Natsuki, But you have to choose.
Rem, Choose?
Subaru Natsuki, Me? Or someone else?
Subaru Natsuki, Choose.
Subaru Natsuki, Let's get a dragon-drawn carriage and head west.
Subaru Natsuki," We'll leave Lugunica and go far west... To Kararagi, was it?"
Subaru Natsuki, We'll buy a little house and live there together.
Subaru Natsuki," Even if bad things happen,I can keep going if you're there."
Subaru Natsuki, Just having someone waiting at home for me with a smile...
Subaru Natsuki," No matter how tired I am,"
Subaru Natsuki," if I know you're waiting for me, I know..."
Subaru Natsuki, Please choose me!
Subaru Natsuki," If you choose me, I'll give you all that I have!"
Subaru Natsuki, So please...
Subaru Natsuki, Run away with me.
Subaru Natsuki, Live with me!
Rem, Subaru-kun...
Rem, I cannot run away with you.
Rem," We're supposed to laugh together,"
Rem," as we talk about the future, remember?"
Subaru Natsuki," Maybe we can't laugh now, but...	"
Subaru Natsuki," You know, once we actually get moving,	"
Subaru Natsuki, I bet we can—	
Rem," I have thought about it, too."
Rem," We would arrive in Kararagi,	"
Rem, and rent a place to stay.	
Rem," As long as we had a home and work,"
Rem, we would get by somehow.
Rem," Fortunately, thanks to Roswaal-sama, I have received an education,	"
Rem," so I think I could easily find work, even in Kararagi."
Rem, You might have to either look for manual labor
Rem, or take care of things around me.	
Rem," Once we had a stable income,"
Rem, we could look for a better place to live.
Rem," In the meantime, you could study"
Rem," for perhaps a year, so that you can find"
Rem," a decent job, until you can actually work."
Rem, We would work together.
Rem," And once we had enough money,perhaps we could buy a house.	"
Rem, Maybe we could even open a shop.
Rem," After all, Kararagi is a thriving commercial area."
Rem, I'm sure we could earn a living on one of your fanciful ideas.
Rem, And once our jobs were on track...
Rem," Um, it's embarrassing to say,"
Rem, but we could have a child.
Rem," It would be half-demon and half-human,"
Rem, so I'm certain it would be feisty.
Rem," Whether we have a boy or a girl,"
Rem," twins or even triplets,"
Rem, I know they would be adorable.
Rem, I'm sure it wouldn't be all fun times.
Rem, And not everything would work out as I imagined it.
Rem," We might have only daughters and no sons,"
Rem, so you might not feel very proud of your family.
Subaru Natsuki, Rem...
Rem, But... But... Even when the children grow
Rem," and reach the age where they start to treat you coldly,"
Rem, I shall still be on your side!
Rem," We will be famous in the neighborhood as a couple of old lovebirds,"
Rem, as we take our time spending life together and growing old...
Subaru Natsuki, Rem...
Rem," I would feel bad for doing it to you,"
Rem," but I would prefer to die before you, if possible."
Rem," I want to die quietly,"
Rem," lying on our bed, with your hand in mine,	"
Rem, surrounded by our children and their children.	
Rem," To say, ""I was so happy,""	"
Rem, as you all look on...	
Rem," I could end my life happily, so happily.	"
Subaru Natsuki, If you...
Subaru Natsuki," If you want it that badly, then..."
Rem," If you could wish for that future with a smile,"
Rem, I would be truly happy to die that way...	
Rem, As long as I could live with you.	
Rem, Just knowing that you want me with you when you run away
Rem," makes me happy, from the bottom of my heart.	"
Rem, But I cannot.
Rem, Because I know	
Rem," that if we run away together now,"
Rem, I would be leaving behind the Subaru-kun that I love most.	
Rem," Subaru-kun,"
Rem, please tell me what happened.
Rem," If you cannot, please trust me.	"
Rem, I swear I shall do something to make it right.
Rem," But for now, at least, we should go back."
Rem," If we take our time,and consider things calmly,"
Rem, maybe we will find a different answer.
Subaru Natsuki, I've already agonized over this.
Subaru Natsuki, I've thought about it.
Subaru Natsuki, I've suffered.
Subaru Natsuki, That's why I gave up.
Rem," It's easy to give up, but..."
Subaru Natsuki, It's easy to give up?
Rem, Subaru-kun?
Subaru Natsuki, Don't give me that!
Subaru Natsuki, There's nothing easy about giving up!
Subaru Natsuki," You think I'm just doing nothing,"
Subaru Natsuki," thinking about nothing,"
Subaru Natsuki," cutting myself off from everything,"
Subaru Natsuki, and throwing everything away!
Subaru Natsuki, And that's all it took to give up?!
Subaru Natsuki, It was not easy to give up!
Subaru Natsuki, It was so much easier for me to think	
Subaru Natsuki, there was something I could do!	
Subaru Natsuki, But there's nothing I can do...	
Subaru Natsuki, There's no way out!	
Subaru Natsuki, The only path everything leads to is giving up!	
Subaru Natsuki," If I could do something,	"
Subaru Natsuki, I would... I would...	
Rem, Subaru-kun...	
Rem, It is easy to give up.	
Rem, But it doesn't suit you.	
Rem," I do not know what painful things you've been through,	"
Rem, or what you have done to make you suffer so.	
Rem, And I know it would be wrong of me
Rem, to thoughtlessly say I understand.
Rem, But... But even so...	
Rem, There is something that I do know.	
Rem, I know that you're someone who cannot give up on something halfway through.
Rem, I know that you are someone who can smile
Rem, when you talk about your wishes for the future.	
Rem, I know...	
Rem, I know that you are someone who cannot give up on the future.	
Subaru Natsuki, You're wrong.	
Subaru Natsuki, I'm not that kind of—	
Rem, I am not wrong.	
Rem, You haven't given up on anyone.	
Rem, Not Emilia-sama or Sister.	
Rem," Or Roswaal-sama, or Beatrice-sama, or anyone else.	"
Subaru Natsuki, I have... I have given up!
Subaru Natsuki, Carrying it all was impossible from the start!	(0:14:19.90)
Subaru Natsuki," My hands are so small,"
Subaru Natsuki," that it all slipped through my fingers, leaving nothing."
Rem," No, that isn't true. You have—"
Subaru Natsuki, What do you know?!
Subaru Natsuki, What do you know about me?!	
Subaru Natsuki, This is the kind of man I am!	
Subaru Natsuki," I have no strength, but I want it all.	"
Subaru Natsuki," I have no knowledge, but all I do is dream."
Subaru Natsuki," There's nothing I can do, but I struggle in vain!	"
Subaru Natsuki, I... I...	
Subaru Natsuki, I hate myself!	
Subaru Natsuki," All I do is talk a big game,	"
Subaru Natsuki," and make myself sound like a big shot, when I can't do anything!	"
Subaru Natsuki," I never do anything,	"
Subaru Natsuki, yet I can complain like a pro.	
Subaru Natsuki, Who do I think I am?!	
Subaru Natsuki, It's amazing that I can live like this and not feel ashamed!	
Subaru Natsuki, Right?!	
Subaru Natsuki, I'm empty...	
Subaru Natsuki, There's nothing in me at all!
Subaru Natsuki, I know that...	
Subaru Natsuki," Yeah, that's obvious...	"
Subaru Natsuki, I know it's obvious.
Subaru Natsuki, Before I came here...	
Subaru Natsuki," Before I got into the situation that led me to all of you,	"
Subaru Natsuki, do you have any idea what I did?	
Subaru Natsuki, I did nothing...	
Subaru Natsuki, I've never done a single thing.	
Subaru Natsuki," I had all that time, all that freedom..."
Subaru Natsuki," I could have done anything,"
Subaru Natsuki, but I never did a thing.	
Subaru Natsuki, And this is the result! What I am now is the result!	
Subaru Natsuki," All of my powerlessness, all of my incompetence,	"
Subaru Natsuki, is the product of my rotten character.	
Subaru Natsuki," Wanting to accomplish something, when I've never done anything,	"
Subaru Natsuki, goes beyond the limits of arrogance!	
Subaru Natsuki, The cost of my laziness and all the wasteful habits in my life	
Subaru Natsuki, just ends up killing both you and me.	
Subaru Natsuki, That's right.	
Subaru Natsuki, I have no character.
Subaru Natsuki," Even when I thought I could go on living here, nothing changed...	"
Subaru Natsuki, That old man saw that part of me perfectly.
Subaru Natsuki, Right?
Subaru Natsuki," I wasn't trying to get stronger,"
Subaru Natsuki, or trying to make things better.	
Subaru Natsuki," I was just striking an obvious pose, to justify myself,	"
Subaru Natsuki," to say that I was trying, that it wasn't like I wasn't doing anything.	"
Subaru Natsuki, I wanted to say I couldn't help it.
Subaru Natsuki, I wanted to be told that it couldn't be helped!
Subaru Natsuki," I only pretended to push my body to the limit, so that would be possible!"
Subaru Natsuki," Even when I had you help me study,	"
Subaru Natsuki, I was just posing to cover up how embarrassed I felt!	
Subaru Natsuki," At heart,	"
Subaru Natsuki," I'm just a small, cowardly, filthy piece of trash,	"
Subaru Natsuki, who's always worried about how others see me. And nothing...	
Subaru Natsuki, Nothing about me has changed!	
Subaru Natsuki, I knew it all along.	
Subaru Natsuki, That all of it was my fault...
Subaru Natsuki, I'm the lowest of the low.	
Subaru Natsuki, I absolutely hate myself...	
Rem, I know...	
Rem," That no matter how deeply you have fallen into darkness,"
Rem, you still have the courage to reach out your hand.	
Rem, I love it when you stroke my hair.	
Rem, I feel as if we can understand each other	
Rem, through the contact between your hand and my hair.	
Rem, I love your voice.	
Rem, Just hearing you say one word	
Rem, makes my heart feel warmer.	
Rem, I love your eyes.	
Rem," Normally, they look stern,	"
Rem," but when you're being kind to someone,	"
Rem, I love the way they soften.	
Rem, I love your fingers.	
Rem," For a boy, you have such lovely fingers.	"
Rem," But when they clutch mine, I know they are the strong,"
Rem, slender fingers of a man.
Rem, I love the way you walk.
Rem," When we walk together,"
Rem," I love the way you occasionally turn,to make sure I keep up."
Subaru Natsuki, Stop...
Rem, I love the way you look when you sleep.
Rem," You look unguarded, like an infant,	"
Rem, and your eyelashes are on the long side.	
Rem," When I touch your cheek, you calm down..."
Rem," And when I playfully touch your lips, you don't even notice..."
Rem, And it makes my heart ache terribly.
Rem, I love you.
Subaru Natsuki, Why?
Rem," When you said that you hate yourself,	"
Rem, it made me want to tell you	
Rem, all the wonderful things I know about you.	
Subaru Natsuki, That was all phony.	
Subaru Natsuki, You just don't know me!	
Subaru Natsuki, I know myself better than anyone!	
Rem, All you know is yourself!	
Rem, How much do you know about the Subaru-kun that I see?!	
Subaru Natsuki, Why... do you like me so much?	
Subaru Natsuki, I'm...	
Subaru Natsuki, I'm weak and small.	
Subaru Natsuki, I'm running away.	
Subaru Natsuki, Just like I ran away last time!	
Subaru Natsuki, So why?	
Rem," Because you are my hero, Subaru-kun!	"
Rem," In that dark forest,	"
Rem, when I didn't even know who I was anymore	
Rem," and couldn't think of anything but violently lashing out,"
Rem, you saved me.
Rem," When I woke up unable to move,"
Rem," and Sister was exhausted after using too much magic,"
Rem," you faced the mabeasts as a diversion, so we could escape."
Rem," There was no way you could win,"
Rem, and your life was in real danger.
Rem," But you still stayed,"
Rem," and came back to my arms, still warm."
Rem," When you woke up, you smiled,"
Rem," and said the words I wanted to hear most,"
Rem," when I wanted to hear them most,"
Rem, from the one I wanted most to hear them from.
Rem, My time has been stopped for so long.
Rem," Ever since that fiery night,"
Rem," the night I lost everything except my sister,"
Rem, my time has been stopped...
Rem," It was you who melted my frozen heart,"
Rem, and kindly made my stopped time begin to move forward again!
Rem," I'm sure you have no idea how you saved me,"
Rem," or how happy I was at that moment, on that morning."
Rem, That's why I believe.
Rem," No matter what painful things happen,"
Rem, even when it looks like you'll lose...
Rem," When no one else in the world believes in you,"
Rem, when you don't even believe in yourself...
Rem, I will believe!
Rem, That the Subaru-kun who saved me
Rem, is a true hero.
Subaru Natsuki," No matter how hard I tried,"
Subaru Natsuki, I couldn't save anyone...
Rem, I am here.
Rem, The Rem you saved is right here.
Subaru Natsuki, I've never done anything. I'm empty.
Subaru Natsuki, No one will even listen to me.
Rem, I am here.
Rem, I will listen to anything you have to say.
Rem, I want to.	
Subaru Natsuki, No one expects anything of me.
Subaru Natsuki, No one believes in me.
Subaru Natsuki, I hate myself.	
Rem," Well, I love you, Subaru-kun!"
Subaru Natsuki, You really don't mind that it's me?	
Rem, I want it to be you.	
Rem, I would not want for it to be anyone else.	
Rem, If you cannot forgive yourself	
Rem," for being empty and having nothing,	"
Rem," then let us start from here, right now.	"
Subaru Natsuki, Start what?	
Rem, Just like you started my time for me
Rem, we will make the time that you feel is stopped for you	
Rem, begin to move again.	
Rem, Let us start here.	
Rem, From square one.	
Rem," No,	"
Rem, from zero!	
Rem," If it is too hard for you to walk alone,	"
Rem, I will hold you up.	
Rem," As we walk, we will share the burden and support each other.	"
Rem, Wasn't this what you said to me that morning?	
Rem," Show me how awesome you can be, Subaru-kun.	"
Subaru Natsuki, Rem...	
Rem, Yes?	
Subaru Natsuki, I love Emilia.	
Rem, Yes.	
Subaru Natsuki, I want to see Emilia smile.
Subaru Natsuki, I want to be of help to Emilia's future.	
Subaru Natsuki," Even if she says I'm in the way,	"
Subaru Natsuki, even if she tells me to stay away...
Subaru Natsuki, I want to be next to her.	
Subaru Natsuki," Using my feelings for her as an excuse,	"
Subaru Natsuki, to get her to understand everything	
Subaru Natsuki," was arrogant of me, huh?	"
Subaru Natsuki, It's okay if she doesn't understand.	
Subaru Natsuki," If there's a bleak, painful future waiting for her,	"
Subaru Natsuki, I want to take her away to a future where we can all laugh together!	
Subaru Natsuki, Will you help me?	
Subaru Natsuki, I can't do anything alone.	
Subaru Natsuki, I lack in everything.	
Subaru Natsuki, I'm not confident that I can even keep walking straight.	
Subaru Natsuki," I'm weak, fragile, and small.	"
Subaru Natsuki," So, to make sure I keep walking straight,	"
Subaru Natsuki," to help me realize when I'm wrong,	"
Subaru Natsuki, will you help me?	
Rem," You are a cruel man, Subaru-kun.	"
Rem, You ask all this of someone you just rejected?	
Subaru Natsuki," Hey, it's also hard for me to ask this of the one who rejected	"
Subaru Natsuki, my once-in-a-lifetime proposal.	
Rem, I humbly accept.	
Rem," If it will help you,	"
Rem," my hero,	"
Rem," greet the future with a smile, then yes.	"
Subaru Natsuki," Yeah, just watch.	"
Subaru Natsuki, You get a front row seat...	
Subaru Natsuki, To see the man you fell for
Subaru Natsuki, become the most awesome hero ever!	
Subaru Natsuki, I'm watching you.	
Subaru Natsuki, You're watching me.	
Subaru Natsuki, So I won't look downward.	
Subaru Natsuki," Natsuki Subaru's story will begin right here, from zero.	"
Subaru Natsuki," My life in another world starts here, from zero!"
